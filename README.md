# openstack-implementation-report
This repository contains a project report on the implementation of OpenStack, including its components, testing, and implementation of IaaS and SaaS. It also includes a simulation of a cloud environment using CloudSim. 

The report aims to provide insights into the implementation of OpenStack and its potential for use in various industries. It covers the creation of a network and a subnet, the creation of a security group with rules that allow SSH and ICMP, the allocation of a new floating IP to our IaaS and SaaS instances, the implementation of IaaS and SaaS, and the simulation of a cloud environment using CloudSim.

The report also includes a directory called `src` containing the source code used in the implementation and simulation of OpenStack. To use the code in the `src` directory, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src` directory.
3. Compile the code using a Java compiler.
4. Run the code using the command `java OpenStackCloudSimulation`.

In addition to the source code, the repository includes a PDF file containing the project report on the implementation of OpenStack. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the implementation process and serves as a guide for those interested in implementing OpenStack in their organizations.
